# Neural_Image_Processing_lab01

## About this lab:

I have created the neural image processing with different datasets - such as MINIST_d, MINIST_f, cifar_10, cifar_100_f, cifar_100_c with vary algorithms such as -  ANN and CNN

## What I did to improve the accuracy of your CNN:
1. Increased number of epochs
2. Put more neurons 
3. Put more layers
4. Increased batch size
